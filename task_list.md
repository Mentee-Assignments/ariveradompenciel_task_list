## Github Objectives
- [ ] Sign up for a [github account](https://github.com/)
- [ ] Read the [git parable](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html)
- [ ] Watch the first chapter lessons about github on [lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html) *note*: sign in using the organization login (uiowa)
- [ ] Watch the second chapter lessons about github on [lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html)
- [ ] Watch the third chapter lessons about github on [lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html)
- [ ] Watch the fourth chapter lessons about github on [lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html)
- [ ] Watch the thirteenth (13th) chapter lessons about github on [lynda](https://www.lynda.com/Git-tutorials/Git-Essential-Training/100222-2.html)
- [ ] If you're still lost, watch more chapters from lynda and/or check out [software carpentry for github](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/). Otherwise, just check this box.
- [ ] [Fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
- [ ] [Clone your forked repository](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)
- [ ] [Edit this markdown file](https://github.com/blog/1825-task-lists-in-all-markdown-documents) to check off all the items you've completed this far
- [ ] commit and push the changes to your forked repository 
- [ ] Open a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) with the [upstream repository](https://github.com/Mentee-Assignments/ariveradompenciel_task_list/) (where this task list originated)

**NOTE**: Now you've worked through a workflow on how collaborative coding/writing works on github!

## Research Objectives
- [ ] Read the [longitudinal analysis papers](https://www.zotero.org/freesurfer/items/itemKey/KSTK6BQQ) #1
- [ ] Read the [longitudinal analysis papers](https://www.zotero.org/freesurfer/items/itemKey/ZIQ5CRTR) #2
- [ ] Spend 20 minutes searching for structure-function relationships you may be interested in on pub-med/google scholar
- [ ] Store the papers you found (or just the freesurfer papers) on some reference management software (I personally like [mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/))
- [ ] Ask Rachel how to analyze the data


## BASH objectives
- [ ] Complete the software carpentry [unix tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/)
- [ ] Read [this tutorial](http://alexpetralia.com/posts/2017/6/26/learning-linux-bash-to-get-things-done) for concept repetition
- [ ] Use [explainshell](https://explainshell.com/) as a resource to understand a bash command (or a series of bash commands) you didn't understand earlier
- [ ] For the initiated, here is another [lynda course](https://www.lynda.com/Bash-tutorials/Up-Running-Bash-Scripting/142989-2.html) that covers bash scripting.

**NOTE**: Yay!, the last item is really if you're interested in writing bash scripts (e.g. besides using it to get around your filesystem and doing simple tasks)
It's interesting, but programming in BASH should really only be used in small tasks, for everything else, there's mastercard, err, I mean [python](https://www.python.org/)


## Neuroimaging Objectives
- [ ] [Read this](https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201644) to begin to understand Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS)
- [ ] Browse the structure of other [BIDS datasets](https://github.com/INCF/BIDS-examples)
- [ ] Try to connect how we named directories/files in the PACR-AD project with the [BIDS manual](http://bids.neuroimaging.io/bids_spec1.0.2.pdf)
